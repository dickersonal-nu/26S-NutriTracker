## The Problem

Starting a diet is difficult, especially with the poorly designed system DineOnCampus provides. Missing items on menus, inaccurate data, and overall student business makes it hard to stay healthy.

**NutriTracker fixes that.**

NutriTracker stores data on food and tracks your daily intake with minimalistic design. Visualize your diet and needs instantly with our program!
